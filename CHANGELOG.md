Added several features such as the VaribaleState and -Guard and fixed some bug. Also the api doc has been completed for `/src'.

* [new] Added `Workflux\State\VariableState` which will automatically set and remove configured execution vars.
* [new] Added `Workflux\Guard\VariableGuard` which provides a shorted way of expressing execution var based transition constraints.
* [chg] Refactored the `Workflux\Parser\Xml\StateMachineDefinitionParser` and extracted `Workflux\Parser\Xml\Xpath` and `Workflux\Parser\Xml\OptionsXpathParser`.
